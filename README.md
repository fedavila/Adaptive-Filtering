# Adaptive Filtering Research

This repository contains Python scripts developed for research on **adaptive filtering** in signal processing. The focus is on system identification and frequency tracking using adaptive techniques.

## Key Features

- Implementation of **single and combined adaptive filters** for system identification.
- Use of **linear adaptive predictors** for signal frequency tracking.
- Evaluation of **convergence, steady-state error, and robustness** under dynamic and noisy conditions.

The scripts are intended for **simulation, analysis, and validation** of adaptive algorithms in research applications.
